## About Project
Adlynk is a software engineering project developed as part of CSC-225 (Software Engineering) at Namal University, Mianwali. The project addresses disconnected and inefficient advertising workflows in Pakistan by providing a centralized digital platform for managing advertising campaigns across multiple channels.

## Key problems:



####  Advertising deals are done manually, which makes the process slow and difficult.

####  Business owners waste time and money managing ads.

#### Billboard and advertising service providers are hard to find.

#### There is no one platform to manage all types of advertising.
