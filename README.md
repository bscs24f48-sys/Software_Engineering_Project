## About Project
Adlynk is a software engineering project developed as part of CSC-225 (Software Engineering) at Namal University, Mianwali. The project addresses disconnected and inefficient advertising workflows in Pakistan by providing a centralized digital platform for managing advertising campaigns across multiple channels.

## Key problems:



####  Advertising deals are done manually, which makes the process slow and difficult.

####  Business owners waste time and money managing ads.

#### Billboard and advertising service providers are hard to find.

#### There is no one platform to manage all types of advertising.

# Data Flow Description
The Adlynk platform centralizes data exchange between four key stakeholders:
## Business Owners: 
                  search for advertising services and submit booking requests with campaign details and payment information. They receive service listings, booking confirmations, and campaign analytics from the platform.
## Service Providers :
                     register their services with availability and pricing data. They receive booking details and client information, then submit campaign reports and performance metrics. Payment notifications are sent upon successful transactions.
## Administrators:
                 manage users and configure system settings while accessing comprehensive reports and analytics dashboards to monitor platform activity.
## Payment Gateway:
                   processes payment requests and transaction data from the platform, then returns payment confirmations and transaction status updates.
The Adlynk platform acts as the central hub, coordinating all interactions, managing bookings, processing payments, and generating reports. This centralized architecture ensures data consistency, security, and efficient communication across the advertising ecosystem.
