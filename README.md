this is my github read me file of my project teacher you maintain poorly maintain it correctly how should i maintain correctlt 100%Your current README.md file appears to be poorly maintained because it contains almost no useful information — just a raw Google Sheets link (which is now broken/404) and possibly an unrelated or non-functional video attachment. This makes the repository look incomplete, unprofessional, and hard for anyone (including future you, collaborators, or recruiters) to understand what the project is about.
A good GitHub README should act as the "front page" of your project: clear, engaging, well-structured, and informative. It helps people quickly grasp the purpose, how to use it, and why it matters.
Why Your Current README is Poorly Maintained

Only a single link and a video → no context or explanation.
Broken external link (Google Sheet not accessible).
No project title, description, setup instructions, or visuals.
No badges, screenshots, or structure — it doesn't invite visitors to explore further.

How to Maintain It Correctly (100% Professional Way)
Follow these best practices to make your README excellent:

Use Markdown formatting — Headings (#), bold (**), lists (-), images ([image]), links (), code blocks (```), etc.
Start with the basics at the top — Project name, tagline, badges.
Keep it updated — Every time you add features, data, or code, update the README.
Make it scannable — Use sections with headings, short paragraphs, bullet points.
Add visuals — Screenshots, GIFs, or diagrams (especially important for data/academic projects).
Be concise but complete — Aim for 500-1500 words; focus on helping users get started quickly.
Include key sections (tailored for what seems like a data/academic project, possibly related to BCS exam syllabus or results).

Recommended README Structure & Template
Here's a complete template you can copy-paste into your README.md file. Replace the placeholders (in brackets) with your actual info.

text### Quick Wins to Improve It 100%
- **Fix the Google Sheet** → Set sharing to "Anyone with link" and update the link.
- **Add images/screenshots** → Upload relevant ones to the repo (in an `images/` folder) and reference them.
- **Add badges** → Use https://shields.io to create cool status badges (stars, license, etc.).
- **Embed the video properly** → If it's a demo, upload to GitHub or YouTube and link/embed.
- **Describe the files** → Explain what `main.tex`, `purposal (2).pdf`, and the video are for.

Once you update it like this, your repo will look professional, get more visibility, and be easier to maintain. If you share more details about what the project actually does (e.g., the spreadsheet content or code), I can refine this template further!4.2sFast57 sourcesthis is my project purposal . now guide me how to maintainPDFpurposal (2).pdfAdlynk: Multi-Channel Advertising Management Platform

About the Project
This project, developed as part of CSC-225 Software Engineering at Namal University, Mianwali, aims to solve the fragmentation in Pakistan's advertising industry. Business owners often struggle with coordinating campaigns across billboards, vehicle branding, social media, and other channels due to manual processes, lack of transparency, and limited access for small businesses.
Adlynk provides a unified platform where users can discover services, book campaigns, and track performance from a single dashboard. It targets small businesses, startups, and e-commerce owners by offering transparent pricing and easy connections to professional advertisers and influencers.
Key problems addressed:

Inefficient manual negotiations and coordination.
High costs and wasted time for business owners.
Limited visibility for service providers like billboard owners.
Lack of a centralized system integrating traditional and digital advertising
